      <h4>Why learn?</h4>
      <p >
        One can not effectively create wealth without knowledge. This is why it is important that before you choose how to spend/invest your money,there is a wisdom one should have. Why,you may ask?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I can answer that that by telling you its possible to run a risk and debt free life. Many Individuals today live in the moment only seeking to make “ends meet “ but this is not the case for someone who truly wants to actually create wealth. The only way to do this is by investing in knowledge.

</p></p>

<div class="row">
<P id="problem">
  <h4>What is the problem?</h4>
  <div class="col-md-9">
<p>The financial system today is not investing/handling your money this way.Banks today just offer a position for you to dump your money and leave it there.This should not be the case because your money can do more than just lying around.It can work for you and make you a rich man before your 30’s.</p><br>
<p>The banks have not taken time to actually invest in their customers by teaching them about how to handle their finances.Don’t believe me ,let me ask you a question?</p><br>
<ol>
  <li>How much profit are you making and what happens to your money when you place it in the bank?</li>
  <li>What other ways can your money work for you?</li>
  <li>Will you income be soaring or falling in the next 30 years?</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Take time and ask yourselves these questions.</p><br></P><br></div>

<h3><strong>Why pasbanc?</strong></h3>
<img src="https://bit.ly/2LKogpa" alt="" class="image-responsive" id="imgsize">
<p>At Pasbanc , your time is our number one priority. For example consider two men with five thousand shillings. At that start you may think because both these men have the same amount of money,they are the same right?, actually you are not right.The question should be how did the money come to each of them.The process is key.</p>
<br>
<p>One man had to exchange his time to get the five thousand shillings,the other just knew how to invest it and let it work really hard for him. Without time you are limited in all your endeavours,the choices you make will be limited.Time is very important.A man’s life is tied to his time.</p><br>
<p><q> Ecclesiastes 2:26 King James Version (KJV) 26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. 

</q></p><br>
<p>We are all about minimising the time we work and maximising wealth. Pasbanc is giving you the time to travel in time to your fifth generation,and ensure that your grand-children will benefit from your financial decisions. Pasbanc is the perfect fit for you because we are going to be with you everystep of the way,learning with you and doing good business together.</p>
